# dotfiles

## install
Clone the repo (I recommend cloning to `~/.dotfiles` but you can put it wherever you like):
```shell
git clone git@github.com:jaymody/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Setup `zsh`:
```shell
./setup
```

Link files in the `dotfiles` folder to `~`:
```shell
./link
```

There's also a [wiki](https://github.com/jaymody/dotfiles/wiki) that contains guides on how I set up my various machines.
